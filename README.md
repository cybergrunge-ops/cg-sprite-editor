# cg-sprite-editor
unhappy with sprite editors out there and also wanted to make my own to get better at javascript.

supports 10 colors, since sprites are just a long string of digits between 0 and 9.

has 4 palettes by default, more can be added easily.


## future stuff to add
- palette editor, more preset/demo sprites and palettes
- allow drawing lines instead of having to click one individual pixel at a time
- allow for adding custom properties to the sprite, that can later be used in a game engine
- flags for various things like collision, size, animation, etc
