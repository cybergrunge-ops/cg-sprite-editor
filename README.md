# cg-sprite-editor
unhappy with sprite editors out there and also wanted to make my own to get better at javascript.

supports 10 colors, since sprites are just a long string of digits between 0 and 9.


## future stuff to add
- palette editor, more preset palettes to use
- more demo sprites
- allow drawing lines instead of having to click one individual pixel at a time
- make sprites be represented by a csv to allow for adding custom properties to the sprite
- as a result of above, give sprites flags for various things like collision, size, animation, etc
